# PokExplorer
The PokExplorer app is extremely simple: given a set of Pokémon (the 251 from 2nd Gen), it will calculate a PCA based on their basic stats (Att., Def., Sp. Att., Sp. Def., Spd., HP). The PCA will be 3D plotted.

- The left panel allows to choose a Pokémon from the list in order to show its picture, stats and its location in the 3D PCA plot.
- The plot itself can be turned in any direction. Lines connecting the points indicate evolutionary relations. Hovering over the points will show a Pokémon's information. The three lists on the bottom allow to choose the PCA projections to be displayed.
